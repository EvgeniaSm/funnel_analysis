# MOIA: How I’d Approach Data Enablement

- Host regular KPI check-ins with product teams
- Define “source of truth” dashboards and ownership model
- Build a KPI inventory per squad (bookings, churn, app adoption)
- Offer SQL/BI training workshops per quarter
- Design feedback loops between PMs and analysts

Bonus: propose an internal “Data Champion” program to spread best practices
