# 📈 Business Insights & Interpretation

## 🔍 What this analysis shows:
- Overall funnel performance across five key user actions
- Drop-off points (e.g. users signing up but never booking)
- Key optimization areas in the user journey

## 🧠 Potential insights:
- High drop-off between signup and app_open? → onboarding friction
- Many users search but don't book? → pricing, availability, UX
- High booking-to-completion drop? → cancellation reasons, failed payments

This type of analysis supports product, UX and operations teams in optimizing the user journey and increasing booking success rates.

# MOIA: How I’d Approach Data Enablement

- Host regular KPI check-ins with product teams
- Define “source of truth” dashboards and ownership model
- Build a KPI inventory per squad (bookings, churn, app adoption)
- Offer SQL/BI training workshops per quarter
- Design feedback loops between PMs and analysts

Bonus: propose an internal “Data Champion” program to spread best practices
