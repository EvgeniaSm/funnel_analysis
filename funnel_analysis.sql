## üîç What this analysis shows:
- Overall funnel performance across five key user actions
- Drop-off points (e.g. users signing up but never booking)
- Key optimization areas in the user journey

## üß† Potential insights:
- High drop-off between signup and app_open? ‚Üí onboarding friction
- Many users search but don't book? ‚Üí pricing, availability, UX
- High booking-to-completion drop? ‚Üí cancellation reasons, failed payments

This type of analysis supports product, UX and operations teams in optimizing the user journey and increasing booking success rates.
