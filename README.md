# Mobility as a Service – Analytics Project

This mini portfolio showcases how I approach data challenges in a product-oriented environment. It includes examples of:
- KPI definition frameworks
- Funnel analysis using SQL
- Dashboard planning for self-service analytics
- Notes on data enablement for product teams

These examples are inspired by typical analyst work in Mobility-as-a-Service and product analytics contexts.

### Advanced Funnel Analysis
- Includes time-to-convert metrics and weekly cohort tracking
- Breaks down full-funnel behavior (signup → booking)
- Ready to be extended with segmentation (device, region, etc.)
