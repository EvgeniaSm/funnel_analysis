# Senior Data Analyst â€“ Sample Portfolio

This mini portfolio showcases how I approach data challenges in a product-oriented environment. It includes examples of:
- KPI definition frameworks
- Funnel analysis using SQL
- Dashboard planning for self-service analytics
- Notes on data enablement for product teams

These examples are inspired by typical analyst work in Mobility-as-a-Service and product analytics contexts.
